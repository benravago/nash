  <h1 id="sec-2" title="2"> Conformance</h1><p>A conforming implementation of ECMAScript must provide and support all the types, values, objects, properties, functions, and
  program syntax and semantics described in this specification.</p>

  <p>A conforming implementation of ECMAScript must interpret source text input in conformance with the Unicode Standard, Version
  5.1.0 or later and ISO/IEC 10646. If the adopted ISO/IEC 10646-1 subset is not otherwise specified, it is presumed to be the

  <p>A conforming implementation of ECMAScript that provides an application programming interface that supports programs that need
  to adapt to the linguistic and cultural conventions used by different human languages and countries must implement the interface
  defined by the most recent edition of ECMA-402 that is compatible with this specification.</p>

  <p>A conforming implementation of ECMAScript may provide additional types, values, objects, properties, and functions beyond
  those described in this specification. In particular, a conforming implementation of ECMAScript may provide properties not
  described in this specification, and values for those properties, for objects that are described in this specification.</p>

  <p>A conforming implementation of ECMAScript may support program and regular expression syntax not described in this
  specification. In particular, a conforming implementation of ECMAScript may support program syntax that makes use of the
  &ldquo;future reserved words&rdquo; listed in <a href="sec-ecmascript-language-lexical-grammar#sec-future-reserved-words">subclause 11.6.2.2</a> of this
  specification.</p>

  <p>A conforming implementation of ECMAScript must not implement any extension that is listed as a Forbidden Extension in <a href="sec-error-handling-and-language-extensions#sec-forbidden-extensions">subclause 16.1</a>.</p>
